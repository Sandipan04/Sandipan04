### 👋 Hey there! I'm [Your Name]  
Mathematics major at NISER Bhubaneswar, occasionally convincing computers to do my bidding.  

#### 🔧 What I Tinker With:
- 🐍 Python enthusiast – mostly for fun, sometimes for chaos.  
- 🌐 Recently built my own GitHub page (HTML, JS, and CSS... yes, I touched frontend).  
- 🎮 Working on some games & simulations for Pi Day 2025 – because math and fun should mix!  
- 🤖 Helped develop *DoorDarshan* – an IoT project for remotely accessing our robotics club door (because why use keys when you have code?).  
- 🚀 Was part of a team building a rover for ISRO’s IROC U-2024. We may have missed the deadline, but hey, the rover still roves!  

#### ⚡ Fun Fact:
Took an ML course, thought I'd make a smart game bot for the Voronoi area game. The bot learned *something*... just not sure *what*.  

💡 Doing all of this for fun. If it breaks, it's *probably* a feature.
